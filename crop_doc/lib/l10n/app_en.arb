    "welcomeDescription": "MaizeDoc is an AI-driven mobile app providing digital extension services for maize farmers. The app uses a ConvDeit-tiny vision transformer to classify maize leaf diseases from uploaded images, reducing human error in diagnosis.It provides locally available treatment recommendations and uses Explainable AI (LIME) heatmaps to show which image regions informed the classification, promoting user trust and transparency in the AI's decision. This complements and assists manual efforts by traditional extension officers.",
